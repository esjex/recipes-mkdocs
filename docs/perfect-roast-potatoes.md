# Perfect roast potatoes

For these three-way roasties, you boil, steam, and then roast your potatoes. This produces potatoes that are soft and fluffy on the inside, and extra crunchy on the outside.

## Ingredients

- As many white potatoes as you want to roast
- Salt
- Pepper
- Dried rosemary (Or your own selection of herbs / spices)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180-200C.
1. Get a roasting tin. Pour in enough cooking oil to cover the bottom of the tin, then put the tin in the oven.
1. Chop potatoes into whatever size you like your roast potatoes.
1. Boil a pan of salted water, enough to cover all your potatoes (but don’t add the potatoes yet!).
1. Whn the water starts boiling, add the chopped potatoes.
1. Let the potatoes boil up and then simmer for around 5 minutes. It's okay if they're not fully cooked at this point.
1. Use a colander to drain the potatoes.
1. Pop a lid on top of the potatoes and let them steam in their own heat for around 5-10 mins (you can either put the potatoes back in the pan or leave them in the colander for this part).
1. Take the roasting tin out of the oven (close the oven door to keep the heat in!), and pour the potatoes into the hot oil. 
    * **Important**: Make sure the oil in the pan is already hot, as if you’re making Yorkshire puddings.
1. Add generous amounts of salt, pepper, and dried rosemary or other herbs you like. Stir with a wooden spoon until all of the potatoes are coated in oil and seasoning.
1. Put the potatoes in the oven and roast until starting to brown (this usually takes around 20-30 mins).
1. Open the oven door and give the roast potatoes a good mix until all the potatoes are coated in oil again. 
1. Put the potatoes in the oven and roast until starting to brown (this usually takes another 20 mins, but judge it by eye).
1. Take the potatoes out of the oven and admire them.

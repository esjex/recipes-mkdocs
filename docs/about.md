# About this site

Hi, I'm Siobhan. I'm a technical writer, technical editor, and content strategist. 

I'm using this content to familiarise myself with creating documentation via static site generators, as part of building out my tech stack. 

In my previous roles as Senior Technical Writer and Chief Technical Editor, I used in-house docs-as-code tooling, and a bit of MadCap Flare. However, now that I'm self-employed, I'm getting up to speed on the many, many tools that can help manage documentation. 

To learn more about my background, find me on [LinkedIn: Siobhan Fitzgerald-Gibson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siobhan-fitzgerald-gibson/).
